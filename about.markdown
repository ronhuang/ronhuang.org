## The Author

I am Ron Huang, also known as Yih-Lun Huang or 黃翊倫. I am
happily married to [Grace Tsao](http://grace.hng.tw/).

Currently, I am a graduate student pursuing PhD degree at Department
of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of
Singapore. My supervisor is [Assist. Prof. Tim
Marsh](http://ap3.fas.nus.edu.sg/fass/cnmmt/).

My research interest includes human-computer interaction, end-user
programming, software engineering, and serious games. I am currently
working on patterns of user experience for software programmers, a
collection of the best practices within the user experience design
domain. But instead of targeting their normal audiences, the
interaction designers, these patterns are transcribed in language
familiar to software programmers. For more information, please refer
to my [CV](/cv/).

I enjoy playing video game, reading fiction, and writing hobbyist
software. Most of my software projects are host at
[GitHub](http://github.com/ronhuang). You can also find me at
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/ronhuang), [Google
Profile](http://profiles.google.com/ronhuang) and
[Facebook](http://facebook.com/ronhuang).
