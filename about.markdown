## The Author

I am a graduate student pursuing PhD degree at Department of
Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of
Singapore. My supervisor is [Assist. Prof. Timothy
Marsh](http://ap3.fas.nus.edu.sg/fass/cnmmt/).

My research interest includes human-computer interaction, end-user
programming, software engineering, and serious games. He is currently
working on patterns of user experience for software programmers, a
collection of the best practices within the user experience design
domain. But instead of targeting their normal audiences, the
interaction designers, these patterns are transcribed in language
familiar to software programmers.

I enjoy playing video game, reading fiction, and writing hobbyist
software. Most of my software projects are host at
[GitHub](http://github.com/ronhuang). He prefers Emacs over vi.
