## The Author

I am Ron Huang, also known as Yih-Lun Huang or 黃翊倫. I am
happily married to [Grace Tsao](http://grace.hng.tw/).

Currently, I am a software engineer at Generalplus Technology Inc.
Before that, I was a graduate student pursuing PhD degree at
Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University
of Singapore. My supervisor was [Dr. Tim Marsh][1]. However, it was
suspended due to [one][2] of the most wonderful event in my life.

My research interest includes human-computer interaction, end-user
programming, software engineering, and serious games. I was
working on patterns of user experience for software developers, a
collection of the best practices within the user experience design
domain. But instead of targeting their normal audiences, the
interaction designers, these patterns are transcribed in language
familiar to software developers. For more information, please refer
to my [CV](/cv/) or [resume][6].

I enjoy playing video game, reading fiction, and writing hobbyist
software. Most of my software projects are host on [GitHub][3]. You
can also find me at [Twitter][4] and [Google+][5].
