Recently, I redesigned my website. It is based on
[HTML5 Boilerplate][2] and [Less Framework][3]. Changes include:

- Followed the [Responsive Web Design][1]. The website is readable
  both on desktop and mobile browsers, even
  [Internet Explorer Mobile 7][16] (sort of.)
- Integrated [Google Custom Search][4].
- Supported [OpenSearch][9]. Viewers can search my website directly
  from Google Chrome's Omnibar, similar to [this][10].
- Changed the font for headers to [Ubuntu][5].
- Changed the font for contents to <span style="text-decoration:line-through">[Vollkorn][6]</span> [Tinos][17].
- Updated favicon. [Grace][11] made the icon for me based on one of
  our marriage photos.
- Used [DataTables][7] instead of [tablesorter][8] to display
  table. Large tables, such as the one in
  [Twitter user names with less than two characters][12], are
  paginated.
- Integrated [Google's 404 widget][13] into the [404 page][14].
- Contents of the website are licensed under a
  [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License][15].
- Various source code refactoring.

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. Thank you.
