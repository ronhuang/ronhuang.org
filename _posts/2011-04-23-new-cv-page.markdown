I have updated my [CV](/cv/) page.

Recently,[^1] I saw an awesome [resume][2] from [CSS-Tricks][1]. Based
on that resume, I created a new CV page of mine. My previous CV page
only contained a link to the PDF version of my CV. I have taken most
of the contents from the PDF version and populated into the HTML
one. However, the link to the PDF is still preserved. So if you prefer
reading PDF, please click [here][4].

Another reason I have created this post is that I realized the keyword
*resume* is not available throughout my website. Google could not find
any page with *[resume][5]*. Though resume is different from CV, I
hope this post will better inform others about myself. [^2]
