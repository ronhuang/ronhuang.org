      <description>Yet again, I switched my blog engine. This time, I switched from Jekyll to WordPress.
I really like how Jekyll works. It&amp;rsquo;s very straightforward and allow me to blog within my editor of choice, Emacs. But it also forces me to blog in front of my laptop, instead of other mobile devices.
After much consideration, I decided to switch to WordPress, a more ubiquitous blog engine which has support on most major platforms.</description>

      <description>Introducing Calennar, seminar schedules in iCalendar format. Currently, this only support seminars from NUS School of Computing. You can subscribe Calennar into your favorite calendar client with the following URL:
http://inmate.ronhuang.org/calennar/nuscs.ics  NUS SoC offers many seminars. However, since I am not from SoC, I do not receive automatic email notifications for these seminars and often missed interesting ones. They do offer web for the seminar schedules, but there are no corresponding RSS or Twitter account to subscribe to.</description>

      <description>I have updated my CV page.
Recently 1, I saw an awesome resume from CSS-Tricks. Based on that resume, I created a new CV page of mine. My previous CV page only contained a link to the PDF version of my CV. I have taken most of the contents from the PDF version and populated into the HTML one. However, the link to the PDF is still preserved. So if you prefer reading PDF, please click here.</description>

      <description>Updated in 2015/12/28: this post is no longer applicable.
Recently, I redesigned my website. It is based on HTML5 Boilerplate and Less Framework. Changes include:
 Followed the Responsive Web Design. The website is readable both on desktop and mobile browsers, even Internet Explorer Mobile 7 (sort of.) Integrated Google Custom Search. Supported OpenSearch. Viewers can search my website directly from Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Omnibar, similar to http://friendfeed.com/bgolub/5e56afb1/i-like-how-google-chrome-deals-with-opensearch. Changed the font for headers to Ubuntu.</description>

      <title>Embed Tweet with a Single Line of Code</title>

      <description>Updated in 2015/12/28: this widget is no longer usable. Please refer to Embed a Single Tweet for similar feature.
In my previous post, I needed to show a tweet. Though I could have embedded a picture of the tweet, I would really prefer a functional one, where the links, mentions, and hashtags are all linkified. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find any useful ones beside Blackbird Pie. Blackbird Pie was OK, but it requires users to manually generate the tweet and embed the generated HTML.</description>

      <title>Taiwan Friendly Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://ron.hng.tw/2011/03/28/taiwan-friendly-wikipedia/</link>

      <description>Although Wikipedia provides menu to switch from different Chinese variants, Wikipedia doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to remember to the users&amp;rsquo; selection. I am tired of manually going through the menu and selecting Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) whenever I browse a new Wikipedia article. So I created Taiwan Friendly Wikipedia, a Google Chrome extension to automatically redirect to the Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) variant when reading Chinese articles.
Users can switch off the automatic redirection in the options.</description>

      <description>Updated in 2012/12/02: moved table to Google Docs.
Today I was curious if all the Twitter user names with less than two characters are already created. So I wrote a tiny script to check.
The result is: YES! All of them are already created. In fact, the last one, lh, was just created today! What a coincidence. However, quite a few user names are suspended, and user name me also seems to be reserved.</description>
