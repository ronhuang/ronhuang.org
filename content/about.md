I am Ron Huang, also known as Yih-Lun Huang or 黃翊倫. I am happily
married to [Grace Tsao].

Currently, I am a software engineer at
[HP Inc.] Before that, I was a graduate student
pursuing PhD degree at Department of Electrical & Computer
Engineering, National University of Singapore. My supervisor was
[Dr. Tim Marsh].

My research interests include human-computer interaction, end-user
programming, software engineering, and serious games. I was working on
patterns of user experience for software developers, a collection of
the best practices within the user experience design domain. But
instead of targeting their normal audiences, the interaction
designers, these patterns are transcribed in language familiar to
software developers. For more information, please refer to my [CV] or
[resume].

I enjoy playing video game, reading fiction, and writing hobbyist
software. Most of my software projects are host on [GitHub]. You can
also find me at [Twitter] or [Mastodon].
