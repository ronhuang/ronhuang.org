Today I was curious if all the Twitter user names with less than two
characters are already created. So I wrote a tiny script to check.

The result is: YES! All of them are already created. In fact, the last
one, [lh], was just created today! What a coincidence. However, quite
a few user names are suspended, and user name [me] also seems to be
reserved. Maybe there is still chance to create one in the future?
