I have updated my [CV](/cv/) page.

Recently [^1], I saw an [awesome resume] from [CSS-Tricks]. Based on
that resume, I created a new CV page of mine. My previous CV page only
contained a link to the PDF version of my CV. I have taken most of the
contents from the PDF version and populated into the HTML
one. However, the link to the PDF is still preserved. So if you prefer
reading PDF, please click [here](/cv/vitae.pdf).

Another reason I have created this post is that I realized the keyword
_resume_ is not available throughout my website. Google could not find
any page with _[resume]_. Though resume is different from CV, I hope
this post will better inform others about myself [^2].
