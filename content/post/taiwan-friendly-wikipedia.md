Although Wikipedia provides menu to switch from different Chinese
variants, Wikipedia doesn't seem to remember to the users'
selection. I am tired of manually going through the menu and selecting
Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) whenever I browse a new Wikipedia
article. So I created [Taiwan Friendly Wikipedia], a Google Chrome
extension to automatically redirect to the Traditional Chinese
(Taiwan) variant when reading Chinese articles.

Users can switch off the automatic redirection in the options. If
disabled, users have to manually click the icon on the Ombibox to
redirect to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) variant article. The default
is enabled (will automatically redirect.)

You can install Taiwan Friendly Wikipedia at [Chrome Web Store]. The
source code is available at [GitHub].
