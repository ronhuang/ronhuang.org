Yet again, I switched my blog engine. This time, I switched from
Jekyll to WordPress.

I really like how Jekyll works. It's very straightforward and allow me
to blog within my editor of choice, Emacs. But it also forces me to
blog in front of my laptop, instead of other mobile devices.

After much consideration, I decided to switch to WordPress, a more
ubiquitous blog engine which has support on most major platforms. Even
underdog like Windows Phone has official app from Automattic. I am
using it right now to write this post.

I can't guarantee I'll write more posts. But at least I have one less
excuse not to update my blog now.
