Yesterday, I announced my latest research topic on Twitter and
Facebook: Software Patterns of User Experience for World of Warcraft
(SPUXWoW).

{{< tweet 53632515516284928 >}}

However, instead of pointing to the actual research page, the link
pointed to [RickRoll'D] on YouTube. As of today, there are a total of
87 people who got rickroll'd by me. Thanks everyone for
participating. Couldn't have done it without you guys. :p

(Seriously, I am sorry for my immature prank. I will do my best to
come up with something more sophisticated next year.)

Anyway, the following are some of the better pranks I enjoyed this year.
