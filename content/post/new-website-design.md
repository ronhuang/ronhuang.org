**Updated in 2015/12/28: this post is no longer applicable.**

Recently, I redesigned my website. It is based on [HTML5 Boilerplate]
and [Less Framework]. Changes include:

- Followed the [Responsive Web Design]. The website is readable both
  on desktop and mobile browsers, even
  [Internet Explorer Mobile 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_Mobile#Version_7)
  (sort of.)
- Integrated [Google Custom Search].
- Supported [OpenSearch]. Viewers can search my website directly from
  Google Chrome's Omnibar, similar to
  http://friendfeed.com/bgolub/5e56afb1/i-like-how-google-chrome-deals-with-opensearch.
- Changed the font for headers to [Ubuntu].
- Changed the font for contents to ~~[Vollkorn]~~ [Tinos].
- Updated favicon. [Grace] made the icon for me based on one of our
  marriage photos.
- Used [DataTables] instead of [tablesorter] to display table. Large
  tables, such as the one in
  [Twitter user names with less than two characters], are paginated.
- Integrated [Google's 404 widget] into the [404 page](/notfound/).
- Contents of the website are licensed under a
  [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License].
- Various source code refactoring.

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. Thank you.
