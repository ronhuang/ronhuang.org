      <description>Yet again, I switched my blog engine. This time, I switched from Jekyll to WordPress.
I really like how Jekyll works. It&amp;rsquo;s very straightforward and allow me to blog within my editor of choice, Emacs. But it also forces me to blog in front of my laptop, instead of other mobile devices.
After much consideration, I decided to switch to WordPress, a more ubiquitous blog engine which has support on most major platforms.</description>

      <description>I have updated my CV page.
Recently 1, I saw an awesome resume from CSS-Tricks. Based on that resume, I created a new CV page of mine. My previous CV page only contained a link to the PDF version of my CV. I have taken most of the contents from the PDF version and populated into the HTML one. However, the link to the PDF is still preserved. So if you prefer reading PDF, please click here.</description>

      <description>Updated in 2015/12/28: this post is no longer applicable.
Recently, I redesigned my website. It is based on HTML5 Boilerplate and Less Framework. Changes include:
 Followed the Responsive Web Design. The website is readable both on desktop and mobile browsers, even Internet Explorer Mobile 7 (sort of.) Integrated Google Custom Search. Supported OpenSearch. Viewers can search my website directly from Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Omnibar, similar to http://friendfeed.com/bgolub/5e56afb1/i-like-how-google-chrome-deals-with-opensearch. Changed the font for headers to Ubuntu.</description>
