      <description>Updated in 2015/12/28: this widget is no longer usable. Please refer to Embed a Single Tweet for similar feature.
In my previous post, I needed to show a tweet. Though I could have embedded a picture of the tweet, I would really prefer a functional one, where the links, mentions, and hashtags are all linkified. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find any useful ones beside Blackbird Pie. Blackbird Pie was OK, but it requires users to manually generate the tweet and embed the generated HTML.</description>

      <description>Updated in 2012/12/02: moved table to Google Docs.
Today I was curious if all the Twitter user names with less than two characters are already created. So I wrote a tiny script to check.
The result is: YES! All of them are already created. In fact, the last one, lh, was just created today! What a coincidence. However, quite a few user names are suspended, and user name me also seems to be reserved.</description>
